Needless to say, many projects have been tried or are running in the field of the blockchain infrastructure service, contributing to both centralized and decentralized mode, on-chain data query and off-chain data on-chain.

‌Infura provides API services for developers by building its own Ethereum and IPFs nodes, keeping developers accessing Ethereum and IPFs node data through API services.

NOWnodes operates in a similar way to Infura, but provides more blockchain network API services. For now, it claims to have provided 45 chain API services.

Api3 constructs a public blockchain and provides Oracle Network, and governs the Network through DAO and Kleros. Api3 builds the Oracle Network by submitting Oracle to the data source provider and providing cross-blockchain aggregation data for DAPP.

BitQuery is a blockchain data engine. By aggregating the data on the blockchain, BitQuery provides the data API on the blockchain to users, and also provides simple data analysis capability and GraphQL API on the blockchain.

The Graph proposes Ethereum and IPFs on-chain service index protocol. By using SubGraph’s definition, the index information is retrieved and established in the smart contract, and GraphQL API is served for users to obtain the data information corresponding to DAPP.

During the existing modes, each project focuses on its specific field. There is no commonly used technical solution connecting to each field.

Both Infura and NOWnodes adopt a centralized approach to provide API services for blockchain nodes or browsers. Api3 offers off-chain data on-chain aggregation service by using the way of submitting by Oracle to the data source provider. BitQuery and the graph focus on the aggregation and indexing of data on the chain, which makes DAPP and offline applications can obtain the data on the chain. Both are providing GraphQL API.

For infrastructure services, the type of services is diverse. In terms of traditional infrastructure services, there are OCR (optical character recognition), SMS (short messaging service), SNS (simple notification service), VPN (virtual private network), etc. For the infrastructure services in the field of blockchain, there are blockchain node API services, blockchain browser API services, blockchain data aggregation, DAPP data aggregation, off-chain data aggregation on-chain, cross-chain data API services, etc. There are more service types waited to be exploded.

‌Summarizing the above service types, there are three critical parts of infrastructure services: Service Discovery, Service Call and Service Billing. These parts are very mature in the centralized IT infrastructure architecture, but they are controlled by operators, which causes the damage of choosing freely for infrastructure service providers and users. We can see how the centralized infrastructure service platforms controlled by commercial companies such as AWS, Azure, AliCloud and Google Cloud control developers. In the decentralized Web 3.0 world, the situation becomes more complex, and these three critical parts are missing and imperfect.

‌In order to solve the problems of infrastructure service discovery, Service Call and Service Billing in the Web 3.0 world, Apron labs proposed Apron Network as a solution to improve the infrastructure service ecology of the Web 3.0 world. In the Web 3.0 era, it is possible for developers to freely provide and use any infrastructure services, which will make the real world connect to the Web 3.0 world, returns freedom to everyone!
